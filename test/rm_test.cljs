;; test/rm_test.cljs -- build the command and compare it with /bin/rm on
;; stdout, stderr, exit status AND the resulting directory tree.
;;
;; mkdir writes nothing to stdout when it succeeds, so an output-only
;; comparison would pass an implementation that created nothing at all. The
;; tree is what carries the weight, exactly as in org-ieee-cp.
;;
;; Both implementations run in the SAME directory, one after the other, with
;; the fixtures rebuilt in between: the diagnostics contain absolute paths, so
;; two parallel trees would differ in stderr for reasons unrelated to the
;; behaviour under test.
